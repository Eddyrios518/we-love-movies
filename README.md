This project was designed to test my ability to build complex servers and access data through a database. 

The following list tested my skills:

    Install and use common middleware packages

    Receive requests through routes

    Run tests from the command line

    Access relevant information through route and query parameters

    Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn't exist

    Build an API following RESTful design principles

    Create and customize a knexfile.js file

    Create a connection to your database with Knex

    Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server

    Return joined and nested data with Knex

    Write database migrations using Knex's migration tool

    Deploy the backend server to a cloud service
    
    I would like to come back and refactor some code and implement different methods to help clean up and make my code more concise.
